    <h2>My Ballet Journey</h2>
    <p>From my first ballet class at age five to performing on stages across the country, ballet has shaped who I am. I believe every dancer has a unique story to tell through movement, and I'm here to help you discover yours.</p>
    
    <h3>My Philosophy</h3>
    <p>Dance is not just about <b>perfect technique</b> – it's about <em>expressing your soul</em> through every gesture. I teach with patience, encouragement, and a deep respect for the art form.</p>
