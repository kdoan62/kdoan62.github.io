    <h2>My Ballet Journey</h2>
    <p>From my first ballet class at Pomona College, ballet has inspired me to express myself with purpose and intention. We believe every dancer has a unique story to tell through movement, and I'm here to help you discover yours.</p>
    
    <h3>My Philosophy</h3>
    <p>Dance is not just <b>acquiring perfection</b> – it's about <em>expressing your soul</em> through every gesture. We teach with patience, encouragement, and a reverence for tradition and modern art form.</p>
